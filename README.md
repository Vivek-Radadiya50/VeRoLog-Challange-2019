# VeRoLog Solver Challenge 2019: Optimal Routing and Installation
Welcome to my GitHub project for solving the VeRoLog Solver Challenge 2019! This repository contains my approach to tackling an exciting and complex routing problem, which involves the distribution and subsequent installation of equipment, such as vending machines. The challenge is to develop an algorithm that minimizes the overall cost, combining my creativity, problem-solving skills, and programming expertise.

# Project Overview:
The VeRoLog Solver Challenge 2019 presents a unique problem that integrates two critical operations: distribution and installation. The goal is to determine the most cost-effective way to deliver and install equipment across various locations. This involves optimizing routes, managing schedules, and ensuring efficient resource utilization.

# Key Features
Advanced Routing Algorithms: Implementation of state-of-the-art routing algorithms to determine optimal delivery paths.
Installation Scheduling: Strategies for efficient scheduling of equipment installations upon delivery.
Cost Minimization: Techniques to minimize overall costs, including transportation, labor, and installation expenses.
